One-line recruiter pitch you can copy
"I maintain a public repo of LLM prompts and workflows demonstrating prompt engineering, evaluation rubrics, and recruiter-friendly outputs."

If you want:
- Example filled outputs added under "ExampleOutputs" entries, say: "Add examples" and I’ll generate them one file at a time.
- Split or rename any file, say: "Rename X to Y" and I’ll prepare the exact commit text.

No private data included.
